# Flow Jupyter

Flow's command line tool is a powerful way to interact with the blockchain, but it comes with traditional limitations. One of the main disadvantages is that it is difficult to remember the correct commands. There are often many different options available for each command and it can be easy to make mistakes.

For a new member it could be a daunting experience to explore and learn the tool while using it. Also, not having a way to save the chain of commands makes it all the more annoying. Advanced operations like interacting with the blockchain via scripts and transactions are definitely cumbersome for a new member from the terminal. Therefore, a handy web interface similar to a notebook could be very beneficial to a new member of the community.

This idea was conceptualized during discussions in the discord dev channels. We believe this tool can improve developer experience many fold.

### Planned Enhancements

1.  Command auto completion support
2.  Command chaining support
3.  Improve UX/UI
4.  Add support to add cadence code in cell
5.  Dockerise and host
